And we know that saving money on flights in one way to do that.","So, when you search for flights, we'll show you all the options to help you get the most value possible. Sometimes, certain cheaper options might carry some risk. That's why they cost less.","Self-transfer","","What does a self-transfer mean for you?","Baggage allowances may also vary by ticket. At the end of your first flight, you'll likely need to pick up your checked baggage and recheck it for your second flight. You might need to pass through security and passport control during each connection (for international flights). You'll also sometimes need a visa if your connection is in a country that requires one.","In summary, self-transfer tickets often offer attractive prices, but you need to be aware of the above before confirming your booking.","Transfer protection","You'll likely have two tickets, each with a separate cancellation or change policy. If anything causes a delay or cancellation of your first flight, you may miss your second flight and have to buy another ticket.","Some of our travel providers offer Transfer protection.","Transfer protection means that the provider has some kind of connection guarantee, and may help you if something goes wrong (e.g. by booking replacement flights for you).","Different providers have different policies for Transfer protection. We'll therefore tell you when a provider is offering transfer protection, and you'll need to find more information once you have been transferred to their site to complete your booking.","Before you book, we want to help you understand what you're signing up for.","","A self-transfer flight means you will have two or more flights to reach your destination. Two different airlines could operate the two flights, but not always. It's also possible that your second flight leaves from another airport to the one you arrived at (we'll always make this clear). You'll then need to transfer yourself from one flight to the next.","To help you choose, we'll let you know when the flight you are looking for is a self-transfer.","","If different airlines from the same alliance (i.e. SkyTeam, Star Alliance etc.) operate your flights, we won't label it as a self-transfer flight. The airlines will transfer your bags and will be responsible for putting you on another flight if your first flight is delayed.","https://help.skyscanner.net/hc/en-gb/requests/new?skyArticle=206028971"
